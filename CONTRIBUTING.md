# Guidelines

- Make sure your editor supports formatting with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install), and format according to `.prettierrc` file before committing.
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages.
- Use [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow) for branching and use [Pull Request Template](./docs/pull_request_template.md) for pull requests.
- Open pull requests for one issue or feature at a time.
- Don't stack [Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests). Always create a new branch from the default branch (like main), not from another feature branch.
- When working on an [issues](https://github.com/b0sc/b0sc.github.io/issues), link the issue number to the pull request using the [Pull Request Template](./docs/pull_request_template.md)
- Try to keep your pull request to a single, meaningful commit. [Squash commits](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-squash-commits/)  if necessary before submission.
- Before starting work, ask a maintainer to assign you the issue on the very own issue comment to avoid duplicate efforts and PRs.
